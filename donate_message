 <b>Pi-Apps depends on you!</b>
 
 I (Botspot) have spent <b>over 300 hours</b> programming Pi-Apps.
 Without financial support, I can't continue developing Pi-Apps as much as I have been. :(
 If every Pi-Apps user pitched in a mere <i>25 cents</i>, I could work on open-source development full-time. 
 
 If Pi-Apps has saved you time &amp; effort, please consider donating. Any amount helps.
