Dear Pi user: <b>Pi-Apps depends on you!</b> 
I (Botspot) have spent <b>over 300 hours</b> programming Pi-Apps, but have nothing to show for it.
Unless things turn around, I won't be able to continue developing Pi-Apps as much as I have been. :(
If every Pi-Apps user pitched in a mere <i>25 cents</i>, I could pay the bills and work on open-source development full-time.
If you like Pi-Apps, please consider donating. Any amount helps.
